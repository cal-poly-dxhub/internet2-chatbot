{transcript}

You are given a transcript from a podcast where different sections are associated with speaker labels like spk_0, spk_1, etc. Your task is to:

1. Read the podcast transcript carefully.
2. Identify the speakers based on the content of their speech.
3. Match each speaker to their corresponding alias (spk_0, spk_1, etc.).
4. Provide a brief description of each speaker based on the information in the transcript.

Please return your analysis in the following xml and JSON format:

<analysis>{
  "speakers": [
    {
      "fullName": "Speaker's full name",
      "speakerId": "spk_X",
      "bio": "Brief description of the speaker's role and background"
    }
  ]
}</analysis>

Ensure your response adheres to this xml and JSON schema:

<analysis>{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "speakers": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "fullName": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Full name of the speaker"
          },
          "speakerId": {
            "type": "string",
            "pattern": "^spk_\\d+$",
            "description": "Unique identifier for the speaker, in the format 'spk_' followed by a number"
          },
          "bio": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Brief biography of the speaker, including their role and background"
          }
        },
        "required": ["fullName", "speakerId", "bio"]
      },
      "minItems": 1
    }
  },
  "required": ["speakers"]
}</analysis>

Important guidelines:
1. Include all speakers mentioned in the transcript.
2. If a speaker's name is not explicitly mentioned, use a descriptive title (e.g., "Host", "Guest 1").
3. The 'bio' should be concise but informative, focusing on the speaker's role in the podcast and any relevant background information mentioned.
4. Ensure the speakerId matches the format in the transcript (e.g., spk_0, spk_1).
5. If you're unsure about any information, indicate this in the bio (e.g., "Role unclear from transcript").

Please provide your analysis based on the transcript content.
